# Variables in proceesing
In (typed) programming languages, values are stored in variables. Each variable has a data type that determines how the contents of that variable are interpreted.

The most common data types in Processing are:

int: to store something that will definitely be a whole number or an integer. Such as,
number of vehicles
lives left
stage of the game
float: to store numerical values that are not guaranteed to be integers, but can have a decimal component. Such as,
speed
time taken
account balance
diameter (there’s more to it than meets the eye)
boolean: values that have only two states (Yes/No, Up/Down, Dead/Alive, Left/Right, …). These values are stored as,
true, representing validity.
false, representing invalidity.
char: characters that are represented as single symbols. These are enclosed in single quote. For example,
'a',
'&',
'6' (as opposed to 6),
' ' (space),
