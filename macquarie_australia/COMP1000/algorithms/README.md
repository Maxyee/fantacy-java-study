# Algorithms in proceesing
Programming itself is the creation of algorithms, of creating recipies for the computer to follow.

But, we never write our programs from scratch, we always write them with help from existing algorithms. That is exactly what you have been doing with your basic Processing programs. Every time you write line(0,0, 100, 100) in Processing, you are saying “please do the line algorithm with the inputs 0, 0, 100, and 100”. Such algorithms are called built-in functions or library functions.
